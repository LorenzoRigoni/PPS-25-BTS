# PPS-25-BTS

## Introduction

The group chose to recreate the famous video game Dr. Kawashima's *Brain Training* in a
slightly simplified version.

It is a game that includes various types of exercises designed to improve brain
functions such as memory, attention, reasoning, and processing speed.
The goal is to keep the brain active and in shape, potentially preventing or slowing down age-related cognitive decline,
and enhancing performance in various areas of life.
